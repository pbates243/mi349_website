                <p>
                    While getting my degree in Media and Infpormation, I focused my learning on video game and web design. Unity is a video game software
                    that is widely used the in the developing world, and it is the software that I am most familiar with. I have experience in Unreal (A Unity competitor), as well as using javascript with html
                    to create all different types of video games, as well as web based applications. Michigan State gave me the opportunity to explore many different types of technology, which were not limited to game
                    and web design. Thanks to my course work through the Communcation Arts and Sciences college, I have experience with many aspects of Video Design, as well as sound design. Due to the current technology 
                    at my disposal, I was unable to save all of my creations. Below I will display a variety of some of my works throughout my college career.

                This project is one or my personal favorites. It is a platformer I created from the ground up, which 
                I used as a final project for one oy my video game design classes. It took over a month to complete, and
                really put my coding skills to the test.

                    This Tetris project was something I created to refresh my Javascript skills. I learned JavaScript in highschool,
                    and did not use it very much until recently. This tetris game was a good way to get refreshed with the syntax.

                This was a final video for a Communcation Arts and Sciences class, in which I was required to create a documentary
                For this project I selected my fellow captain Dex, to create a 6 minute documentary about our Ultimate Frisbee 
                organization at Michigan State.
