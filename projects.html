                <h2>My work</h2>
                <p>
                    While getting my degree in Media and Infpormation, I focused my learning on video game and web design. Unity is a video game software
                    that is widely used the in the developing world, and it is the software that I am most familiar with. I have experience in Unreal (A Unity competitor), as well as using javascript with html
                    to create all different types of video games, as well as web based applications. Michigan State gave me the opportunity to explore many different types of technology, which were not limited to game
                    and web design. Thanks to my course work through the Communcation Arts and Sciences college, I have experience with many aspects of Video Design, as well as sound design. Due to the current technology 
                    at my disposal, I was unable to save all of my creations. Below I will display a variety of some of my works throughout my college career.
